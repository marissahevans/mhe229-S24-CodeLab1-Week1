# Homework project for weeks 1, 2 & 3 

This is a 3D game where the player (teal ball) navigates a maze and collects items (pink capsules) using WASD controls. 

Scene 1 - maze elevated on a platform with a camera shift to phase two of the maze, a ramp with obsticals and more collectables. 

Scene 2 - (IN PROGRESS) once player reaches the ground a second task will begin. Player, GameManager and GroundPlane are singletons that carry between the two scenes. 

TODO: 
[] Build task in Scene 2
[] Show current score in text (points added for collectables)
[] Save score as output and create high score load screen
[] Add sounds?
